# Compound Interest Calculator

Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan.

Annual Compound Interest Formula:
A = P(1+r/n)^n

Where:

A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for
